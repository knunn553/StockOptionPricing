# European_Barrier_Options_Pricing
As a part of the coursework requirement for Computation Methods of Finance, I constructed a generic barrier option binomial option tree with assistance from the YouTube video "Barrier Option Pricing with Binomial Trees || Theory & Implementation in Python." This procedure was completed with Python in Jupyter Notebook.

From a financial perspective, this is an example of how "market makers" accurately price options within the financial derivatives market. There are several ways that options can be priced. The Black Scholes model and Binomial Option Pricing are two popular pricing methods. It is important to note that since this is a European option, we can set a definitive price on the option. If we were dealing with an American option, we would not be able to use either pricing method due the American option's uncertain expiration date.
